The *HTML* file is edited so that it meets the web accesibility criteria. 
Semantic *HTML* tags are used throughout the index.html file.
The *CSS* file has been updated to reflect changes on the *HTML* file as well as to make sure that the *CSS* selectors are not redundant.

## The files meet the following criteria so that:
* The webpage is **web accesible**.
* Semantic *HTML* elements are used through out the __index.html__ file.
* The structure of *HTML* elements are organzed so that the **elements follow a logical structure** independent of styling and positioning
* Accessible **alt** attributes are included on all image tags
* The heading attributes fall in sequential order
* A **concise and descriptive** title is is devised so that the title conveys a meaningful message.
